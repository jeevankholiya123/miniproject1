# About the project
In my first mini project, i have cloned a homepage of BBC.com news website and linked some of the local news template with their links.
When clicking on the links on the top bar which includes signin, weather,sports, etc., it will redirect to the original website's content. it was done intentionally to make the webpage more dynamic.
However, i still haven't used javascript element in this project and i intend to do so in my next mini project.
